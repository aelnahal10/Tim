This is a complete overhaul of our navigation system, simplified path for both users and developers

`npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`

`yarn add @react-navigation/native`

`yarn add react-native-gesture-handler`

`npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`

`(IF the next step results in "The expected package.json path: C:\Users\gjfer\Downloads\Tim-main\package.json does not exist"
    Right click package.json and open integrated terminal then yarn install)`
    
`yarn install`

`expo run`
